    <h2>Data privacy</h2>
    <p>By using this system you're sharing your personal data. That's important, and even during a crisis we need to make sure that's protected. Any of the fields you complete on the forms, or information you share later via other means might be stored so we can co-ordinate.</p>
    <p>We're storing the data you've sent us on Google Apps, via Zapier. We'll use this data for purpose of matching and co-ordinating efforts to supply food during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
    <p>The Developer Society will manage the data securely and share the smallest amount possible to co-ordinate support. Once the tool is no longer required, all data will be deleted. None of the data will be sold.</p>
